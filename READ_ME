Documentation:
* Used Intellij tool and java language for Automation.
* Since I worked with Selenium for a long time, I have Hands on Experience on it so I have used this approach.

* I have used pageobject model so that all the elements can be found at a place. You can find all the elements in
"PageObject Package" and the file name is "PageObject"
* In have added the functions to capture Screenshot and to access the path for properties file in "Utility" Class.You
can find the class in "common package"
* Stored the "url,email,password,text and keyword" in "url.properties" file so that it will be easy to change the values.
* "web.java" is the main class in which I have created an instance to access the PageObject class and invoked the
functions for performing an action.
* Screenshot is captured and also error is displayed when the test is executed.

* Path for the Main Class: Web - src - test - java - main - web.java
* Path for the PageObject Class: Web - src - test - java - PageObject - PageObject.java
* Path for the Utility Class: Web - src - test - java - common - Utility.java
* Path for the Url.properties: Web - url.properties
